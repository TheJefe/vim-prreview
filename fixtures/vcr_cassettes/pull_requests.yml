        first commit allows nvim to toggle between DFS and BFS for the `:find` command
        by running `:set breadthfirst` or `:set nobreadthfirst`. The second just changes
        the names of variables because calling a \"queue\" a \"stack\" makes no sense.\r\n\r\nTo
        test it, I went into my root directory and ran\r\n```\r\n/$ time /home/admin/src/neovim/build/bin/nvim
        -c '':find vim.h | :q'' \r\n1.12user 0.76system 0:01.89elapsed 99%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata
        9300maxresident)\r\n0inputs+328outputs (0major+12437minor)pagefaults 0swaps\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe
        format got garbled from having run vim through it, but it found `vim.h` in
        just over a second! In that amount of time, even the linux program find is
        still reading my `~/.cabal` directory (quite huge).\r\n\r\n**Caveats:** I''m
        not sure my test and `make test` are very comprehensive. I had a segfault
        to fix on builds that ran through the tests perfectly, and this wouldn''t
        be the first time I broke vim without a test reporting it. I also have been
        considering disabling `breadthfirst` during certain operations other than
        `:find`.\r\n\r\nAlso, the source warned:\r\n\r\n>  * The search algorithm
        is depth first. To change this replace the\r\n * stack with a list (don''t
        forget to leave partly searched directories on the\r\n * top of the list).\r\n\r\nI
        don''t fully understand the meaning of that. I thought the logic of what to
        leave on the list or take off was implemented in the calling code of `ff_push()`
        and `ff_pop()`, so I''d imagine that by just overloading those, I''m done.
        Assuming that, I edited this comment to reflect the changes.\r\n\r\n*Update*:

        like to start a discussion with this pull request. It''s still a bit rough,
        please bear with me.\r\n\r\nThis introduces a proxy server implementation
        (based on WEBrick) and configures the browser to use that proxy server. Thus
        the proxy server now receives any requests made by the browser. The proxy
        server internally uses the rack test framework to invoke the app to test.
        This allows us to easily test apps which use multiple domains. \r\n\r\nRight
        now the proxy server forwards all requests to the web app (similar to the
        RackTest adapter), but it''d be relatively easy to extend this to actually
        forward some requests to remote servers or use net mocking frameworks to mock
        requests.\r\n\r\nBesides the selenium proxy driver included in the pull request,
        I also created one for Poltergeist:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Capybara::Poltergeist::ProxyDriver
        < Capybara::Poltergeist::Driver\r\n  def initialize(app, opts={})\r\n    phantomjs_options
        = opts.delete(:phantomjs_options) || []\r\n    phantomjs_options.push(\r\n      \"--proxy=http://#{Capybara.server_host}:#{Capybara.server_port}\",\r\n      \"--proxy-type=http\",\r\n      \"--ignore-ssl-errors=true\")\r\n    super(app,
        opts.merge(phantomjs_options: phantomjs_options))\r\n  end\r\n  def needs_server?\r\n    false\r\n  end\r\n  def
        needs_proxy?\r\n    true\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nRegister those drivers
        like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nCapybara.register_driver :poltergeist_proxy do
        |app|\r\n  Capybara::Poltergeist::ProxyDriver.new(app)\r\nend\r\n\r\nCapybara.register_driver
        :selenium_proxy do |app|\r\n  Capybara::Selenium::ProxyDriver.new(app)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne
        limitation, we need to configure the proxy driver''s host and port to make
        sure they are available, for instance:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nCapybara.configure
        do |config|\r\n  config.javascript_driver = :selenium_proxy\r\n  config.server_host
        = \"127.0.0.1\"\r\n  config.server_port = 23798\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nI''d

        mainly to test our multi-domain app. Thanks.","score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jnicklas/capybara/issues/1404","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jnicklas/capybara/issues/1404/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jnicklas/capybara/issues/1404/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jnicklas/capybara/issues/1404/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/pull/1404","id":43562809,"number":1404,"title":"Add
